summary: tiny stealth game about stealing things

`Screenshots pending.`

a demo project I made for prototyping [Child of the Night]. Nothing shown here made it into the game in any form sadly, 'twas a chaotic time.

`source code pending, back then I was using Unity Collab for some ungodly reason.`
